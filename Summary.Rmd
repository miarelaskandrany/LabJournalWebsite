Psychology Paper: It's All In Your Head: Expectations Create Illusory Perception In A Dual-Task Set Up

In this paper, the authors explain that the perception focuses on two things, sensory data and prior knowledge. One of these aspects many dominate the other if one of them is degraded in a way. The reliability of sensory data is dependent on attention. In this experiment, a dual task setting is used in which participants are often asked about the stimuli relevant for one task and only rarely are they asked about the stimuli relevant for another task. Through this, the experimenters wanted to understand why some participants perceive illusory stimuli while others don’t, the necessary ingredients of an experimental paradigm that is designed to elicit illusory perception, and what type of attention illusory perception is dependent on. They also used an autism spectrum quotient which measures autism-like traits in a subclinical population due to autism’s relationship with prediction errors. The researchers understand that autistic participants tend to exhibit reduced susceptibility to certain illusions and they expected that participants with higher AQ scores will experience less illusory perception. In order to perform the experiments, a computer-controlled experimental display a SUN CM751U CRT monitor with 1024×768 pixels resolution and 100 Hz refresh rate as well as the Radboud Faces Database was used. In the first experiment, there were ten female and six male participants, and they were tasked with identifying the gender of the image on the screen. There was also an arrow cue that would point to the left or the right of the screen for 150 ms. The image would also appear either on the left or the right side of the screen. Participants fixated on a cross in the center of the screen and then direct their attention to the cued location. On 90% of the trials, the participants were asked to identify the gender using the keyboard. On 10% of the trials, the auxiliary task was implemented in which participants were asked to rate the clarity of the square surrounding the image on the screen. On six trials, the participants were asked about the clarity of the box even though the square was not present. RESULTS There were two parts in the second experiment that used the same participants. The first part of the experiment presented two faces on the screen
